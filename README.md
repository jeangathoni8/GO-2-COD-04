## Security

Fortify Passwords uses the Web Crypto API's `crypto.getRandomValues()` for generating cryptographically secure random values. This ensures that generated passwords are truly random and secure.

Password strength is calculated based on:

- Password length
- Character set variety
- Character distribution

No passwords are stored or transmitted - all generation happens locally in your browser.
